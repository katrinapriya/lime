<p>Greetings from the Innovation Resources Database,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations, your organization and resources is included in the <a href="http://bit.ly/in-resources" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/in-resources&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576116021202000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHmq2opLngkSR2ek1IXpjZ1QG1pqw">Innovation Resources Database</a> used by UC Berkeley and the City of Berkeley and beyond. This is a collaborative resource used by multiple departments to provide access to up-to-date information to support innovators and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>We are implementing a new system in which organizations may modify their resources with their own credentials. We have automatically generated an account for you. The credentials are given below:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="<%= @resource_edit %>">CLICK HERE</a> to sign in and CONFIRM or EDIT your resource description.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Use your email: <%= @email %></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And this temporary password: <%= @password %></p>
<p>&nbsp;To ensure that this database is useful and relevant, we will reach out to you once a year to ensure that the content is still accurate. (We will also notify you if your url is broken or a funding deadline passes so you may make those updates.)</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting the innovation ecosystem at Cal and beyond as we scale.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:berkeleyinnovationresources@gmail.com">berkeleyinnovationresources@gmail.com</a>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
