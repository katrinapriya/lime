<p>Greetings from the Innovation Resources Database,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your organization and resources&nbsp;are existing resources&nbsp;to the <a href="bit.ly/in-resources">Innovation Resources Database</a> used by UC Berkeley and the City of Berkeley and beyond. This is a collaborative resource used by multiple departments to provide access to up-to-date information to support innovators and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>We are implementing a new system in which organizations may modify their resources with their own credentials. We have automatically generated an account for you. The credentials are given below:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">CLICK HERE to&nbsp;LOGIN and view your resources&nbsp;[button]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Use your email: <%= @email %></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And this temporary password: <%= @password %></p>
<p>&nbsp;To ensure that this database is useful and relevant, we will reach out to you once a year to ensure that the content is still accurate. (We will also notify you if your url is broken or a funding deadline passes so you may make those updates.)</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting the innovation ecosystem at Cal and beyond as we scale.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please email [tbd &ndash; <a href="mailto:in-resources@berkeley.edu">in-resources@berkeley.edu</a> which will forward to me for now].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jill Finlayson</p>
<p>on behalf of the Innovation Resources Collaboration</p>
