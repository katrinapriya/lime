		<div class="accordionContent">
      	<p>If you are a regular user accessing the database, you shouldn't be concerned about the "Admin" capabilities of this website. A functionality we have for this website app is that we can give certain people "Admin" capabilities to help maintain, fix, and keep up-to-date their resources or all resources in the database as a whole. In order to create an account, you will need to be provided with a "Registration Key" by us.</p>
